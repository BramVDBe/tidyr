## Introduction

Rectangling is the art and craft of taking a deeply nested list (often sourced from wild caught JSON or XML) and taming it into a tidy data set of rows and columns. There are three functions from tidyr that are particularly useful for rectangling:

* `unnest_longer()` takes each element of a list-column and makes a new row.
* `unnest_wider()` takes each element of a list-column and makes a new column.
* `hoist()` is similar to `unnest_wider()` put only plucks out selected 
  components, and can reach down multiple levels.
  
A very large number of data rectangling problems can be solved by combining this functions with a splash of dplyr code. To illustrate these techniques, we'll use the repurrrsive package, which provides a number of datasets with deeply nested lists originally captured from JSON APIs.
  
```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(repurrrsive)
```

## GitHub users

We'll start with `gh_users`, a list which contains information about six GitHub users. To begin, we put the `gh_users` list into a data frame:

```{r}
users <- tibble(user = gh_users)
```

This seems a bit counter-intuitive: why is the first step in making a list more to make it more complicated? But a data frame has a big advantage: it bundles together multiple vectors so that everything is tracked together in a single object.

Each `user` is a named list, which we want to turn into columns.

```{r}
names(users$user[[1]])
```

There are two ways to turn the list components into columns. `unnest_wider()` takes every component and makes a new column:

```{r}
users %>% unnest_wider(user)
```

But in this case, there are many components and we don't need most of them so we can instead use `hoist()`. `hoist()` allows us to pull out selected components using the same syntax as `purrr::pluck()`:

```{r}
users %>% hoist(user, 
  followers = "followers", 
  login = "login", 
  url = "html_url"
)
```

`hoist()` removes the named components from the `user` list-column, so you can think of it as moving components out of the inner list into the top-level data frame. 

## Github repos

We start off `gh_repos` similarly, by putting it in a tibble:

```{r}
repos <- tibble(repo = gh_repos)
repos
```

In this case, the elements of `user` are a list of repositories that belong to that user. These should become new rows, so we use `unnest_longer()` rather than `unnest_wider()`:

```{r}
repos <- repos %>% unnest_longer(repo)
repos
```

Then we can use `unnest_wider()` or `hoist()`:

```{r}
repos %>% hoist(repo, 
  login = c("owner", "login"), 
  name = "name",
  homepage = "homepage",
  watchers = "watchers_count"
)
```

Note the use of `c("owner", "login")`: this allows us to reach two levels deep inside of a list. An alternative approach would be to pull out just `owner` and then put each element of it in a column:

```{r}
repos %>% 
  hoist(repo, owner = "owner") %>% 
  unnest_wider(owner)
```


## Game of Thrones characters

`got_chars` has a similar structure to `gh_users`: it's a list of named lists, which each element of the inner list describing some attribute of a GoT character. We start in the same way, first by creating a data frame and then by unnesting each component into a column:

```{r}
chars <- tibble(char = got_chars)
chars

chars2 <- chars %>% unnest_wider(char)
chars2
```

This is more complex than `gh_users` because some component of `char` are themselves a list, giving us a collection of list-columns:

```{r}
chars2 %>% select_if(is.list)
```

What you do next will depend on the purposes of the analysis. Maybe you want a row for every book and tv series that the character appears in:

```{r}
chars2 %>% 
  select(name, books, tvSeries) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(books, tvSeries), names_to = "media", values_to = "value") %>% 
  unnest_longer(value)
```

Or maybe you want to build a table that lets you match title to name:

```{r}
chars2 %>% 
  select(name, title = titles) %>% 
  unnest_longer(title)
```

(Note that the empty titles (`""`) are due to an infelicity in the input `got_chars`: ideally people without titles would have a title vector of length 0, not a title vector of length 1 containing an empty string.)

## Geocoding with google

Next we'll tackle a more complex form of data that comes from Google's geocoding service. It's against the terms of service to cache this data, so first write a very simple wrapper around the API. This relies on having an Google maps API key stored in an environment; if that's not available these code chunks won't be run.

```{r}
has_key <- !identical(Sys.getenv("GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"), "")
if (!has_key) {
  message("No Google Maps API key found; code chunks will not be run")
}

# https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding
geocode <- function(address, api_key = Sys.getenv("GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY")) {
  url <- "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json"
  url <- paste0(url, "?address=", URLencode(address), "&key=", api_key)

  jsonlite::read_json(url)
}
```

The list that this function returns is quite complex:

```{r}
houston <- geocode("Houston TX")
str(houston)
```

Fortunately, we can attack the problem step by step with tidyr functions. To make the problem a bit harder (!) and more realistic, I'll start by geocoding a few cities:

```{r, eval = has_key, cache = TRUE}
city <- c("Houston", "LA", "New York", "Chicago", "Springfield")
city_geo <- purrr::map(city, geocode)
```

I'll put these results in a tibble, next to the original city name.

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc <- tibble(city = city, json = city_geo)
loc
```

The first level contains components `status` and `result`, which we can reveal with `unnest_wider()`:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  unnest_wider(json)
```

Notice that `results` is a list of lists. Most of the cities have 1 elements, but Springfield has two. We can pull these out into separate rows with `unnest_longer()`:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  unnest_wider(json) %>% 
  unnest_longer(results)
```

Now these all have the same components, as revealed by `unnest_wider()`:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  unnest_wider(json) %>% 
  unnest_longer(results) %>% 
  unnest_wider(results)
```

We can find the lat and lon coordinates by unnesting `geometry`:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  unnest_wider(json) %>% 
  unnest_longer(results) %>% 
  unnest_wider(results) %>% 
  unnest_wider(geometry)
```

And then location:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  unnest_wider(json) %>%
  unnest_longer(results) %>%
  unnest_wider(results) %>%
  unnest_wider(geometry) %>%
  unnest_wider(location)
```

We could also just look at the first address for each city:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  unnest_wider(json) %>%
  hoist(results, first_result = 1) %>%
  unnest_wider(first_result) %>%
  unnest_wider(geometry) %>%
  unnest_wider(location)
```

Or use `hoist()` to dive deeply to get directly to `lat` and `lng`:

```{r, eval = has_key}
loc %>%
  hoist(json,
    lat = list("results", 1, "geometry", "location", "lat"),
    lng = list("results", 1, "geometry", "location", "lng")
  )
```

## Sharla Gelfand's discography

We'll finish off with the most complex list, from [Sharla Gelfand's](https://sharla.party/posts/discog-purrr/) discography. We'll start the usual way: putting the list into a single column data frame, and then widening so each component is a column. I also parse the `date_added` column into a real date-time (I'd normally use `readr::parse_datetime()`, but I can't here because it's a vignette and I don't want to introduce another dependency to tidyr).

```{r}
discs <- tibble(disc = discog) %>% 
  unnest_wider(disc) %>% 
  mutate(date_added = as.POSIXct(strptime(date_added, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"))) 
discs
```

At this level, we see information about when each disc was added to Sharla's discography, not any information about the disc itself. To do that we need to widen the `basic_information` column:

```{r, error = TRUE}
discs %>% unnest_wider(basic_information)
```

Unfortunately that fails because there's an `id` column inside `basic_information`. We can quickly see what's going on by setting `names_repair = "unique"`:

```{r}
discs %>% unnest_wider(basic_information, names_repair = "unique")
```

The problem is that `basic_information` repeats the `id` column that's also stored at the top-level, so we can just drop that:

```{r}
discs %>% 
  select(-id) %>% 
  unnest_wider(basic_information)
```

Alternatively, we could use `hoist()`:

```{r}
discs %>% 
  hoist(basic_information,
    title = "title",
    year = "year",
    label = list("labels", 1, "name"),
    artist = list("artists", 1, "name")
  )
```

Here I quickly extract the name of the first label and artist by indexing deeply into the nested list. 

A more systematic approach would be to create separate tables for artist and label.

```{r}
discs %>% 
  hoist(basic_information, artist = "artists") %>% 
  select(disc_id = id, artist) %>% 
  unnest_longer(artist) %>% 
  unnest_wider(artist)

discs %>% 
  hoist(basic_information, format = "formats") %>% 
  select(disc_id = id, format) %>% 
  unnest_longer(format) %>% 
  unnest_wider(format) %>% 
  unnest_longer(descriptions)
```

Then you could join these back on to the original dataset as needed.
